# Power BI Desktop Project

This repository contains a tutorial on how to use Power BI Desktop, a data visualization and analysis software, to create interactive reports and dashboards from various data sources.

## Project Description

The project includes a line chart, bar charts, table and matrix that visualize various aspects of a company that sells bike accessories. These visualizations provide insights into the company's sales performance and order status.

## Importance of Visualization

Data visualization is a critical part of any data analysis. Visualizations make complex data more accessible, understandable, and usable. They can reveal patterns, trends, and insights that might go unnoticed in text-based data. In this project, we use Power BI Desktop to create visualizations that tell a story about the company's performance.

## Visualizations

1. **Sum of LineTotal by Month and ProductLine**: This line chart shows that the product line S (Sport-100 Helmet) has the highest LineTotal in most months, followed by M (Mountain Tire), R (Road Tire), and T (Touring Tire).

2. **Sum of LineTotal by Month and Order Status**: These bar charts show that the company has more Lost and Returned orders in the first half of the year than in the second half, and that Back Order orders are relatively low throughout the year.

3. **ProductName %GT Sum of LineTotal**: This pie chart shows that the Sport-100 Helmet (in three colors: Black, Blue, and Red) accounts for more than 30% of the LineTotal, followed by the Mountain Tire and the Road Tire. The other products have less than 5% of the LineTotal each.

## Getting Started
